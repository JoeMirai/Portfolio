Electify is a web application built using the Flask web framework in Python. The app is designed to allow users to view information about political parties and vote for their preferred party.

The app includes several pages, such as a home page that displays a list of political parties, a party page that provides detailed information about a selected party, and a login page that allows an administrator to access an admin page.

The home page displays a list of political parties that are stored in a MySQL database, and users can click on a party to view more detailed information on the party page. The party page displays the name and platform of the selected party, Users can also vote for their preferred party on the party page, but only if they are eligible to vote and have not already voted.

The app also includes an admin page that is accessible through the login page. The admin page allows an administrator to add or delete political parties, as well as download a CSV file containing information about the users.

My Flask App is designed to be user-friendly, secure, and scalable, and includes several custom design elements and animations to enhance the user experience. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, and Python and MySQL for the back-end.```
